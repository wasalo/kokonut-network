<h4><i>What is a DAO?</i><a href="https://kokonut.network/wiki/faq#what-is-a-dao">&nbsp;</a></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a community-led entity with no central authority. It is fully autonomous and transparent; smart contracts lay the foundational rules and execute the agreed-upon decisions, proposals, and voting.&nbsp;<a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@kokonut">Read more in our blog...</a></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://link.kokonut.network/dao">Kokonut DAO</a>&nbsp;is the core vehicle for all fundraising, reward distributions, and governance decisions.</p>
