# Executive Summary

## TL;DR üóíÔ∏è <a href="#user-content-tldr" id="user-content-tldr"></a>

* We are [**building an ecosystem**](https://link.kokonut.network/press) to connect Web3 and agriculture.
* We created a blockchain-based cooperative to develop and manage a network of Syntropic Farms.
* Our main goal is to address the [**worldwide lack of funding for agricultural projects**](https://youtu.be/ZjygLVUSq4s).
* We partner with [**farmers**](https://link.kokonut.network/KKN-Seeds-Deck) and get the funds they need while creating opportunities for web3 communities by enabling them access to perpetual natural assets.

Kokonut Network leverages blockchain and open-source accounting tools to create a community-owned network of nature-based, sustainable assets. Our mission is to encourage, organize, fund, and oversee purpose-based Syntropic Farms.&#x20;

Kokonut Network forges partnerships with its members, leveraging the [Kokonut Framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/), which utilizes a combination of Agriculture, Blockchain, Land, and Weather. Our model has no expiration date because coconut trees are replanted when they cease to bear fruit.

### Why coconuts ü••: Zero Waste & Circular Crop ‚ôªÔ∏è
