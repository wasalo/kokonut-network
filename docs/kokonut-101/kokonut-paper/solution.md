# Solution

Blockchain open data and protocols offer a solution that benefits DAO members, farmers, and partners. This involves simplifying fundraising and coordination processes while actively monitoring fauna, flora, and endangered species to create a holistic solution.&#x20;

Through a [framework](https://framework.kokonut.network/) with bullet-proof standardized processes, we create job opportunities and enhance the quality of life for those contributing to the network's well-being. The objective is to establish a fair mechanism for funding, managing, and developing Syntropic Farms while maintaining a commitment to environmental preservation.
