# Frequently Asked Questions

### **What is a DAO?**

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a community-led entity with no central authority. It is fully autonomous and transparent; smart contracts lay the foundational rules and execute the agreed-upon decisions, proposals, and voting. [Read more in our blog...](https://paragraph.xyz/@kokonut)

The [Kokonut DAO](https://link.kokonut.network/dao) is the core vehicle for all fundraising, reward distributions, and governance decisions.

***

### **How do I join Kokonut DAO?**

We have created a [YouTube channel](https://link.kokonut.network/youtube) with Desktop PCs and mobile phone [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQusJMd1NgIIMOuxtJppSIA/playlists) available to guide you through the signing-up procedure.

***

### **Do members share ownership of the property?**

No, Kokonut DAO [members](https://link.kokonut.network/members) own the coconut plant as long as they hold their DAO tokens. Each token is backed 1:1 with a real coconut plant on the land.

***

### **What happens if crypto goes down?**

Kokonut Network is unaffected by the crypto market because the Kokonut DAO only receives tributes in [stablecoins](https://link.kokonut.network/treasury). Coconut plants are bear-market-proof, and the coconut market is rising, as you can see [here](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/coconut-products-market).

***

### **What will the governance look like?**

We have created a detailed [Governance Framework](kokonut-dao/governance-framework.md) on how decisions and operations work within Kokonut DAO instances.

***

### **Aren’t NFTs & Tokens bad for the environment?**

It depends on which blockchain you use. [Kokonut DAO](https://link.kokonut.network/dao) lives in the [Gnosis Chain](https://docs.gnosischain.com/). Based on 2020 energy reports, the network consumes the same amount as two households in the USA. For example, Visa uses the same energy as \~42,000 family homes to operate its network yearly.

***

### **What is the long-term plan?**

Once the plants have reached the end of their useful life, we will replace them with new ones, thus restarting the production cycle.

***

### **Why Blockchain?**

Kokonut Network leverages blockchain for transparency, governance & member protection.

***

### **Are we going to be selling only coconuts?**

The project's main purpose is to plant coconuts due to their flexibility and stability. We plan to open a voting process for the shareholders to vote on whether they want us to process the coconuts (milk, oil, etc.), thus increasing the rewards. The main philosophy of Kokonut Network is to distribute all the power and benefits among the shareholders and communities involved.

***

### **Where is the project located? Can I visit?**

You will be authenticated with your Blockchain wallet and issued a _DAO Member Pass_. Our initial set of projects takes place in the Dominican Republic.

***

### **How do we track Kokonut DAO transactions?**

Visualize & track the inflows & outflows at [Kokonut DAO vaults](https://link.kokonut.network/dao).

***

### **Who have control over Kokonut DAO?**

Moloch DAOs don’t have any admins or trusted intermediaries. All decisions are via proposals, which execute directly against the treasury or vaults using smart contracts.

***

### **How many tokens do I need to participate in governance?**

The minimum amount of tokens needed to participate in governance is 1 Kokonut DAO Voting token.
