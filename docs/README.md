# Frequently Asked Questions

### _**What is a DAO?**_

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a community-led entity with no central authority. It is fully autonomous and transparent; smart contracts lay the foundational rules and execute the agreed-upon decisions, proposals, and voting.

The [Kokonut DAO](https://link.kokonut.network/dao) is the core vehicle for all fundraising, reward distributions, and governance decisions.

### _**How do I join?**_

We have created a [YouTube channel](https://link.kokonut.network/youtube) with Desktop PCs and mobile phone [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQusJMd1NgIIMOuxtJppSIA/playlists) available to guide you through the signing-up procedure.

***

### _**Do members share ownership of the property?**_

No, Kokonut DAO [members](https://link.kokonut.network/members) own the coconut plant as long as they hold their DAO tokens. Each token is backed 1:1 with a real coconut plant on the land.

***

### _**What happens if crypto goes down?**_

Kokonut Network is unaffected by the crypto market because the Kokonut DAO only receives contributions in [stablecoins](https://link.kokonut.network/treasury). Coconut plants are bear-market-proof, and the coconut market is rising, as you can see [here](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/coconut-products-market).

***

### _**What will the governance look like?**_

We have created a detailed [flow chart](https://link.kokonut.network/diagram) on how governance and operations work within Kokonut Network.

***

### _**Aren’t NFTs bad for the environment?**_

It depends on which blockchain you use. [Kokonut DAO](https://link.kokonut.network/dao) lives in the [Gnosis Chain](https://docs.gnosischain.com/). Based on 2020 energy reports, the network consumes the same amount as two households in the USA. For example, Visa uses the same energy as \~42,000 family homes to operate its network yearly.

***

### _**What is the long-term plan?**_

Once the plants have reached the end of their useful life, we will replace them with new ones, thus restarting the production cycle.

***

### _**Why Blockchain?**_

Kokonut Network uses blockchain for transparency, governance & member protection.

***

### _**Are we going to be selling only coconuts?**_

The project's purpose is to plant and sell coconuts. We plan to open a voting process for the shareholders to vote on whether they want us to process the coconuts (milk, oil, etc.), thus increasing the rewards. The main philosophy of Kokonut Network is to distribute all the power and benefits among the shareholders and communities involved.

***

### _**Where is the project located? Can I visit?**_

You will be authenticated with your Blockchain wallet and issued a _DAO Member Pass_. The project takes place in Las Salinas, the province of Barahona, Dominican Republic. [See location.](https://link.kokonut.network/map)

***

### _**How much time until the first harvest?**_

Coconuts fruits usually take about \~3 years until they start bearing fruits.

***

### _**How do we track Kokonut DAO transactions?**_

Visualize & track the inflows, outflows & consolidated closing for your DAO vaults.

***

### _**Who have control over Kokonut DAO?**_

Moloch DAOs don’t have any admins or trusted intermediaries. All decisions are via proposals, which execute directly against the treasury or vaults.

***

### _**How many tokens do I need to participate in governance**_**?**

The minimum amount of tokens needed to participate in governance is 1 Kokonut DAO Voting token.
