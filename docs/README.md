# Frequently Asked Questions

### **What is a DAO?**

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a community-led entity with no central authority. It is fully autonomous and transparent; smart contracts lay the foundational rules and execute the agreed-upon decisions, proposals, and voting.

The [Kokonut DAO](https://link.kokonut.network/dao) is the core vehicle for all fundraising, reward distributions, and governance decisions.

### **How do I join Kokonut DAO?**

We have created a [YouTube channel](https://link.kokonut.network/youtube) with Desktop PCs and mobile phone [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQusJMd1NgIIMOuxtJppSIA/playlists) available to guide you through the sign-up procedure.

***

### **Do members share ownership of the property?**

No, Kokonut DAO [members](https://link.kokonut.network/members) own the upside derived from the plants as long as they hold their DAO tokens. Each token is backed 1:1 with a real coconut plant.

***

### **What happens if crypto goes down?**

Kokonut Network is unaffected by the crypto market because the Kokonut DAO only receives tributes in [stablecoins](https://link.kokonut.network/treasury).

***

### **What will the governance look like?**

We have created a detailed [Governance Framework](kokonut-dao/governance-framework.md) on how decisions and operations work within Kokonut DAO instances.

***

### **Aren’t NFTs & Tokens bad for the environment?**

It depends on which blockchain you use. [Kokonut DAO](https://link.kokonut.network/dao) lives in the [Gnosis Chain](https://docs.gnosischain.com/). Based on 2020 energy reports, the network consumes the same amount as two households in the USA. For example, Visa uses the same energy as \~42,000 family homes to operate its network yearly.

***

### **What is the long-term plan?**

Once the plants have reached the end of their useful life, we will replace them with new ones, thus restarting the production cycle; a coconut plant can last for up to 20 years in optimal productive condition.

***

Kokonut Network leverages blockchain for transparency, governance & member protections.
