# Kokonut Legacy DAO

[**Moloch DAOs**](https://daohaus.mirror.xyz/U_JQtheSzdpRFqQwf9Ow3LgLNG0WMZ6ibAyrjWDu_fc) don't have any administrators or trusted intermediaries. All decisions are made through proposals executed directly against the treasury or vaults.

| **Terminology**      | **Definition**                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network Chain**    | Kokonut DAO is deployed on [**Gnosis Chain**](https://docs.gnosischain.com/), a highly secure, resilient, and decentralized EVM-compatible layer 1 network. |
| **Moloch Framework** | Any DAO member can withdraw their stake and receive a proportional share of the Kokonut DAO treasury assets.                                                |
| **Permissionless**   | Contributors can enforce governance through Rage-quit, allowing them to remove their tribute from Kokonut DAO if they are uncomfortable with its direction. |

### DAO Components

**Moloch DAO Tokens:** Non-transferable tokens, which are “Soul Bound” to your wallet, cannot be sold in the open market. No one can take away your ownership of Coconut Trees.
