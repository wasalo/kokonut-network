# DAO Instances

#### **Kokonut Network fully embodies the spirit of a “DAO.”**

To realize our vision, we are deploying multiple instances of the same core thesis: Community-Governed Decentralized Autonomous Entities.&#x20;

We recognize that no single solution can solve the complex challenges of human coordination. That’s why we’re committed to embracing a variety of governance mechanisms, frameworks, and platforms.

Our goal is to build a resilient hyperstructure that unites diverse stakeholders, without relying on a single token or point of failure.
