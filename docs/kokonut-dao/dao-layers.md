# DAO Layers

> Our DAO Thesis is powered by 4 Layers that aim to provide stability to the network ‚öñÔ∏èüß¨

#### Governance Layer

This layer is composed of Kokonut [DAO members](https://link.kokonut.network/members). They oversee and vote on proposals that benefit the Kokonut Network. Anyone who holds at least one Kokonut DAO token can participate in DAO governance.

#### Logic Layer

This layer is where the [DAO Treasury](https://link.kokonut.network/treasury), list of token holders, funding, and membership proposals vote live securely. All the information critical for the project's transparency and longevity is publicly available on the Gnosis Chain.

#### Execution Layer

After approval by Kokonut DAO members, this layer functions as the body responsible for executing the budget and work plan. It comprises the [Core Team](https://kokonut.network/about), Kokonut DAO Contributors, and Global Enterprise Partners.

#### Production Layer

**This is where the magic happens!** In this layer, we bring our mission to life: building, producing, and distributing Coconuts & Derivatives products globally. [Kokonut V1](https://kokonut.network/kokonut-v1) is our first plantation to be funded via Kokonut DAO, comprising 60,000 coconut plants across 620 acres of land, with an annual production of 18 million coconuts.
