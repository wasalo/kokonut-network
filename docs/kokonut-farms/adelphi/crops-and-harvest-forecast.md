# Crops & Harvest Forecast

* **Short cycle:** Lettuce, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, arugula, and other minor crops.
* **Medium cycle:** [Indian Yam](https://www.gbif.org/species/2755239)_,_ [Passion Fruit](https://www.gbif.org/species/2874190)
* **Long cycle:** Coconut

**Total Production Formula = `(Planting Density per m²) × (Bed Area in m²) × (Number of Beds per Plot of Land) × (Number of Plots of Land) × (1 - Loss Rate)`**

## Short Cycle

### Lettuce Production Forecast for 10 Plots of Land

#### **Variables Formula**

The total lettuce production is calculated using the following formula:

* **Planting Density:** 12 lettuces/m²
* **Bed Area:** 25 m².
* **Number of Beds per Plot of Land:** 19
* **Number of Plots of Land:** Defined based on the cultivated area.
* **Loss Rate:** 15% (0.85)

#### **Applied Example**

1. **Lettuce per bed:** `12 lettuces/m² * 25 m²` = 300 lettuces/bed.
2. **Lettuce per plot of land:** `300 lettuces/bed * 19 beds/plot of land` = 5,700 lettuces/plot of land.
3. **Lettuces in 10 plots of land:** `5,700 * 10` = 57,000 lettuces before loss adjustment.
4. **Applying a 15% loss:** `57,000 * 0.85` = **48,450 effective lettuces.**

#### **Production Time**

The lettuce production cycle depends on the cultivated variety:

* **Loose-leaf lettuce:** 30 to 45 days.
* **Head lettuce (Iceberg, Romaine, etc.):** 60 to 75 days.

> With fast-growing varieties, up to **8-10 cycles per year** can be achieved.

#### **Additional Considerations**

* The loss rate may vary depending on crop management and climate conditions.
* Factors such as soil health, irrigation, and pest control affect final production.
* Keeping production records is recommended to refine future loss projections.

#### **Selling Price**

Each lettuce will be sold wholesale in the range of **$0.55 - $0.63 per unit.**

#### **Estimated Total Revenue per Harvest:**

* **Minimum:** `48,450 lettuces × $0.55` = **$26,647.50**
* **Maximum:** `48,450 lettuces × $0.63` = **$30,523.50**

#### **Annual Revenue Projection for Lettuce**

* Revenue per harvest: **$26,647.50**
* Number of harvests per year: **5.**

**Annual Forecast: `Total annual revenue = $26,647.50 USD/harvest × 5 harvests`=** 133,237.50 USD

## Medium Cycle

### Passion Fruit Production Forecast **for 8 Plots of Land**

#### **Variables Formula:**

* **Area per plot of land:** 629 m²
* **Planting spacing:** 3x3 meters (9 m²/plant)
* **Plants per plot of land:** 70
* **Plants in 8 plots of land:** 560
* **Annual production per plant:** 100 passion fruits
* **Loss Rate:** 15% (0.85)
* **Annual production per plant with Loss Rate**: 85 passion fruits
* **Selling price per net:** $3.01 (each net contains an average of 13 passion fruits)

#### **Annual Revenue Calculation:**

* **Total annual production:** _`85 passion fruits/plant × 560 plants` = 47,600 passion fruits_
* **Number of nets to be produced:** _`47,600 passion fruits ÷ 13 passion fruits/net` = 3,661 nets_
* **Total annual revenue:** _`3,661 nets × 3.01 USD/net` = 11,019 USD_

## Long Cycle

### Coconut Production **for 8 Plots of Land**

#### **Variables Formula:**

* **Area per plot of land:** 629 m²
* **Planting spacing:** 7x7 meters (49 m²/plant)
* **Plants per plot of land:** 12
* **Plants in 8 plots of land:** 96
* **Annual production per plant:** 75 coconuts
* **Loss Rate:** 15% (0.85)
* **Annual production per plant with Loss Rate**: 64 coconuts
* **Selling price per coconut:** 0.79 USD

#### **Annual Revenue Calculation:**

* **Total annual production:** _`64 coconuts/plant × 96 plants` = 6,144 coconuts_
* **Total annual revenue:** _`6,144 coconuts × 0.79 USD/coconut` = 4,853.76 USD_
