# The Land’s Story

### **The Rebirth of a Dream: Yanny and Neury Hernández**

Yanny and Neury Hernández, sisters and single mothers, grew up in a farming family, spending their vacations surrounded by nature at their grandparents' countryside home. From a young age, they felt a deep connection to the land and always dreamed of returning to the countryside—to live off the land and preserve their ancestors' legacy.

Although they were raised in the city, Yanny worked for years in the pharmaceutical industry, while Neury built a career as a professional manicurist. But their love for farming and the countryside never faded. Two years ago, they took a bold step and purchased a piece of land, hoping to one day retire there. However, the high cost of living in the city has made it challenging to finance the cultivation of their land.

This is how **"Adelphi"** was born—a project not only meant to secure their future, but also to benefit the surrounding community. **Adelphi** is dedicated to producing organic and agro-ecological crops, with a focus on preserving biodiversity and regenerating the soil. Additionally, it will serve as a learning space, offering workshops and courses on sustainable practices for the local community.

Near the farm, in a region close to a batey and the Haty community, Yanny and Neury plan to invite children, the elderly, and other community members on weekends to participate in educational, recreational, and leisure activities. This space will not only serve as a refuge for them but also as a gathering place for those interested in learning about organic farming, environmental care, and sustainability.

The project will also feature a nursery dedicated to the conservation of endangered plant species, particularly native fruit varieties. They will employ agro-ecological methods such as biochar soil enrichment to regenerate the land and preserve biodiversity, ensuring that the farm is not just a place of production, but a catalyst for positive change in the community and its surroundings.

> **"Adelphi" is more than just an agricultural project—it is a space for transformation, where people can reconnect with nature and embrace a healthier, more balanced way of life. Yanny and Neury are not just planting crops; they are sowing the seeds of a sustainable future, filled with hope for themselves and their community.**
