### **Project Summary (Abstract)**

This project aims to establish a sustainable agro-ecological production model that integrates soil restoration, biodiversity conservation, and organic food production. It employs an innovative approach based on syntropic farming principles, biochar application, and productive diversification. A total of 13,838 m¬≤ will be dedicated to the agro-ecological production of vegetables, fruits, and forest species, ensuring the project's economic sustainability through commercialization in organic markets and local supermarkets.

Additionally, a specialized nursery will be set up to conserve endangered species, contributing to ecosystem restoration and environmental education within the community. The project will also include the construction of a free-range layer hen mini-farm and a natural fertilization system utilizing biochar and processed poultry manure.

At the community level, the initiative will promote farmer and local community training through an agro-ecological education center, offering workshops with modules focused on agroforestry, and courses on organic production, regenerative soil management, and environmental conservation strategies. In the medium term, the project aims to expand by acquiring nearby lands for the preservation of local flora and fauna, solidifying a replicable model of sustainable production that benefits both ecosystems and the community.

#### **General Objective**

Implement a regenerative agro-ecological production model that ensures environmental, social, and economic sustainability through soil restoration, biodiversity conservation, and organic food production, while promoting environmental education and commercialization in local markets.

#### **Specific Objectives**

* **Regenerate soils** through the application of biochar, remineralization, and ground cover to improve fertility and reduce erosion.
* **Diversify agro-ecological production** with short, medium, and long-cycle crops, including strategic fruit and forest species.
* **Conserve native and endangered species** by establishing a specialized nursery for the propagation and reintroduction of native flora.
* **Implement a sustainable animal production system**, featuring free-range laying hens and the use of byproducts for fertilization.
* **Train farmers and local communities** in agro-ecological and sustainable practices, fostering environmental education and the adoption of best practices.
* **Expand the project** by acquiring additional land for the conservation of flora and fauna, promoting long-term sustainability.
