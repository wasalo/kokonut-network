# Crops, Biodiversity, and Infrastructure

### **Project Sustainability**

The project will allocate **13,838 m²** to establishing an **agro-ecological garden**, designed as the foundation for long-term sustainability. The produce from this garden will be distributed in organic markets, promoting access to **healthy and sustainable food**. The long-term goal is to **expand production and distribution to national supermarket chains**, fostering more nutritious eating habits and strengthening the agro-ecological sector.

### **Productive Diversification and Species Conservation**

#### **Fruit and Agroforestry Production**

In the **higher areas** of the land, **fruit orchards** will be established with key crops such as [**Lipsticktree**](https://www.gbif.org/species/2874863)**,** [**passion fruit**](https://www.gbif.org/species/2874190)**, and** [**Indian Yam**](https://www.gbif.org/species/2755239). Additionally, the project will prioritize **the rescue of endangered fruit species**, including [**Custard Apple**](https://www.gbif.org/species/5407123) **and** [**soursop**](https://www.gbif.org/species/5407273), contributing to the preservation of the region’s **agrobiological heritage**.

#### **Wildlife Sustainability and Ecological Restoration**

A **plantation system** will be implemented to support **ecological restoration and local wildlife**. This will include **honey-producing, fruit-bearing, and ornamental species**, such as [**Hispaniola palmetto**](https://www.gbif.org/species/2732565)**,** [**Florida fiddlewood**](https://www.gbif.org/species/2925390)**,** [**Princess vine**](https://www.gbif.org/species/3039173)**, bejuco,** [**Logwood**](https://www.gbif.org/species/2950903)**,** [**Custard Apple**](https://www.gbif.org/species/5407123)**, and various species from the Sapotaceae family** (e.g., [**Naseberry**](https://www.gbif.org/species/2884162)**,** [**Star Apple**](https://www.gbif.org/species/2885828)**, and** [**Mammee Apple**](https://www.gbif.org/species/3189421)). Additionally, species of **high ecological value** will be cultivated, including [**Jagua**](https://www.gbif.org/species/2895593)**,** [**cashew**](https://www.gbif.org/species/5421368)**,** [**guavaberry**](https://www.gbif.org/species/3186420)**,** [**Congo coffeetree**](https://www.gbif.org/species/2895528)**, and** [**native cacao**](https://www.gbif.org/species/3152205).

#### **Nursery for the Conservation of At-Risk Species**

The project will feature a **specialized nursery** for the reproduction of **endangered, critically threatened, and highly vulnerable plant species**. This nursery will play a vital role in **propagating native varieties**, which will be **distributed for free** to visitors and nearby communities, **promoting conservation and ecosystem restoration** in degraded areas.

### **Agro-ecological Techniques and Soil Regeneration**

#### **Use of Biochar for Soil Improvement**

All crops will be managed using [**biochar**](https://regenerationinternational.org/2018/05/16/what-is-biochar/), produced from **bamboo** found along the farm's boundaries. The biochar will be created through **pyrolysis**, incorporating **various mineral-rich rocks** to enhance **soil regeneration** and improve **nutrient retention capacity**.

#### **Implementation of Syntropic Farming**

A total of **2 plots of land** will be dedicated to **syntropic farming**, optimizing plant interactions to **strengthen biodiversity** and **restore soil fertility**.

#### **Vegetative Cover Systems and Erosion Control**

To **protect and regenerate the soil**, a **permanent ground cover system** will be implemented, utilizing [**beard grass**](https://www.gbif.org/species/5677150) along the edges of **terraced areas**. This strategy will **reduce erosion**, improve **soil structure**, and ensure a **resilient and sustainable production system**.

### **Regenerative Poultry Production**

#### **Free-Range Egg Production**

A **small-scale poultry farm** will be established with **110 free-range laying hens**, producing an estimated **100 eggs per day**. The hens will be fed with **forage grown on-site**, including **Pangola grass**, optimizing the use of local resources.

#### **Organic Waste Management for Biofertilizers**

The [**poultry manure**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_manure) will be processed into **humic acids** and **organic urea**, essential products for fertilizing the **bio-intensive garden**. This approach will **enhance soil regeneration** and **close the nutrient cycle** within the production system.

### **Infrastructure and Training**

#### **Agro-ecological Training & Education Space**

A **multipurpose gazebo** will be built, serving as a **dining area, meeting room, and training center**. This space will host **regular workshops and courses** on **organic farming, agroforestry, and ecological regeneration**, fostering **knowledge exchange** and training new generations in **sustainable practices**.

#### **Organic Certification & Market Distribution**

The project will pursue **official organic certification** from the **Ministry of Agriculture**, ensuring compliance with **quality and sustainability standards**. Harvested products will be distributed through **supermarkets and specialized organic food businesses**, strengthening a **responsible and sustainable distribution network**.

#### **Expansion & Conservation**

Future plans include acquiring **additional land** for the **preservation of local flora and fauna**, enhancing **ecological balance** in the region. This expansion will also **increase organic vegetable production**, benefiting a wider community and **improving access to healthy foods** in local markets.
