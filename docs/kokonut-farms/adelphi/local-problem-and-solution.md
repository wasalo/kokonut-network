<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Kokonut_Adelphi_Public_Nouns_Value_Flywheel.png" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="https://publicnouns.wtf/vote/69">Public Nouns Proposal #69</a> funded our Critical Infrastructure; this allowed us to customize Adelphi as a public good by design.</p></figcaption></figure>

The local community faces significant challenges, including economic hardship, food insecurity, and environmental degradation. Many struggle with limited job opportunities, forcing them to seek work elsewhere. Access to affordable, nutritious food is scarce, contributing to malnutrition and poor health.

Additionally, unsustainable agricultural practices have led to soil depletion and biodiversity loss, threatening long-term food production. Women, in particular, face barriers to economic independence and leadership in agriculture. Without a sustainable approach, these issues will continue to impact livelihoods and the regionâ€™s ecological balance.

### **Economic Hardship & Limited Employment Opportunities**

* **Problem:** Many in the community, including Yanny and Neury, struggle with the high cost of living and limited economic opportunities.
* **Solution:** The project creates a **sustainable source of income** through organic agriculture, while also generating **jobs** for the community.

### **Lack of Access to Sustainable Farming & Education**

* **Problem:** Traditional agricultural practices often degrade the land, and knowledge of sustainable farming methods is limited.
* **Solution:** Adelphi provides **training and workshops** on organic farming and soil regeneration, empowering locals with **valuable skills** to improve their agricultural practices.

### **Food Insecurity & Poor Nutrition**

* **Problem:** The local community may not easily access fresh, organic, and nutritious food.
* **Solution:** By growing **organic and agroecological crops**, the project increases access to **healthy, locally sourced food**, reducing reliance on processed or imported products.

### **Environmental Degradation & Loss of Biodiversity**

* **Problem:** Deforestation, poor farming practices, and lack of conservation efforts contribute to soil depletion and biodiversity loss.
* **Solution:** Adelphi promotes **agroforestry, biodiversity conservation, and soil regeneration** through methods like biochar soil enrichment and a nursery for endangered plant species.

### **Social & Cultural Disconnection from the Land**

* **Problem:** Many younger generations in rural areas are disconnected from traditional farming and sustainable land use.
* **Solution:** The farm serves as an **educational and community hub**, offering activities for children and adults to **reconnect with nature**, preserve cultural traditions, and learn about sustainability.

### **Limited Recreational & Educational Spaces for the Community**

* **Problem:** The community lacks safe, engaging spaces for learning, recreation, and social gathering.
* **Solution:** The project will host **weekend programs** for children, the elderly, and other community members, fostering a sense of **community engagement and well-being**.

### **Gender Inequality & Limited Opportunities for Women**

* **Problem:** Women in rural areas often face barriers to economic independence and land ownership.
* **Solution:** As a **women-led** initiative, Adelphi empowers women by **creating leadership opportunities** in sustainable agriculture and business management.
