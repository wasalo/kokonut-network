# Kokonut Manifesto

Kokonut Network is a platform built by and for people. At its core, [Kokonut DAO](https://link.kokonut.network/dao) seeks to empower anyone who adds value to the Kokonut Network ecosystem, regardless of their social status or prior accomplishments.

The core ethos of Kokonut Network is to create a genuinely self-sustaining protocol with integrity at its heart. The community should always be prioritized over capital.

The drive to create a truly open ecosystem will take shape over time. At launch, Kokonut Network established the Kokonut DAO - the governing entity responsible for allocating funding for Kokonut Network development and distributing rewards to contributors.

**Kokonut DAO Principles**

* **Freedom of Choice** - You can join and leave whenever you want.
* **Freedom of Work** - Collaboration is both necessary and encouraged.
* **Freedom of Power** - No single person owns the Kokonut DAO. Those with the most influence are those who are adding the most value.
* **Freedom of Access** - Anyone who adds value should receive DAO tokens.
* **Freedom to Pay** - Anyone with DAO tokens can submit a funding proposal.
* **Freedom of Opinion** - Not all opinions will be unanimous. We encourage people to speak up and challenge any initiative or proposal that goes against the core ethos of Kokonut Network.
