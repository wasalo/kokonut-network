## Syntropic Farming: Why Is It Worth Implementing?

Kokonut Network is committed to a sustainable future, driven by the following key reasons:

1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction**: Greenhouse gases are a major driver of global warming, and the current [industrial food production releases approximately 26% of these emissions.](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food)
2. **Combating Climate Change**: Merely reducing greenhouse gas emissions is not enough to mitigate climate change. However, it can work effectively in conjunction with soil carbon sequestration by implementing regenerative farm management.
3. **Increased Yields**: Regenerative agriculture strongly promotes organic farming. Organic farms are less susceptible to extreme weather conditions and produce more crops under unfavorable weather conditions than traditional agricultural businesses.
4. **Drought Resilience**: Organic matter retains soil moisture and enhances water retention and infiltration. Building soil organic matter is a central technique in regenerative agriculture.
5. **Support for Local Economies**: Local regenerative agriculture contributes to the development of sustainable local economies.
6. **Biodiversity Conservation**: Versatile species benefit not only the agricultural business but also [environmental sustainability](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2626366?seq=1), which is ultimately essential in regenerative agriculture.
7. **Enhanced Nutritional Value**: The diversity of cultivated crops ensures a more balanced nutrition.

# AgriTech & MRV Features

We monitor the farms using remote sensing technologies (drones and satellite photos), and through satellite monitoring combined with climatic data, we will analyze the health of vegetation and crops. For satellite monitoring, we will implement images from [Landsat 8](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-8) and [Sentinel](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/home) satellites combined with advanced analysis tools.

Also, through the use of drones, we will fulfill multiple functions, such as mapping different areas, analyzing vegetation indices, and monitoring crops, and diseases. This will result in a reduction in production costs, increased efficiency and productivity, time savings, and better management decisions.

|     |     |

| Measurement Type | Methodology |
| Soil Mosture Probes | **Volumetric Water Content**: Determines the amount of water present in the soil in relation to its total volume, providing an accurate measurement of moisture levels in the various soil layers. **Electrical Conductivity**: Measures the soil’s ability to conduct electricity, which is an important indicator for assessing soil salinity and nutrient availability. **Soil Temperature**: Records the soil temperature, a crucial factor that influences the biological and chemical processes affecting plant growth and development. |
| Ground Analytics | Crop Cycle Plant Analysis Water Analysis Soil Texture Diseases |

> This information enables more efficient and sustainable management of irrigation and nutrients, improving both crop yields and the conservation of natural resources.

## Vegetation & Environment Indices

#### [NDVI](https://gisgeography.com/ndvi-normalized-difference-vegetation-index/) (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)

It is the most common vegetation index in remote sensing. We will use it throughout the crop production season, except when vegetation and its canopy are too sparse, as its spectral reflectance is too low.

> ```
> Fórmula: NDVI = (NIR – RED) / (NIR + RED)
> ```

#### [ReCl](https://www.livestocking.net/vegetation-indices-use-in-farming)

The ReCl vegetation index responds to the chlorophyll content in leaves, which is nourished by nitrogen. ReCl reflects the photosynthetic activity of vegetation. We will use it during the active development phase of the vegetation.

> ```
> Fórmula: ReCI = (NIR / RED) – 1
> ```

#### [NDRE](https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/4190/PDF) 

It combines the spectral bands of near-infrared (NIR) and a specific band for the narrow range between visible red and the transition zone (the so-called red-edge region). We will use this index to monitor crops that have reached the maturity phase.

> ```
> Fórmula: NDRE = (NIR – RED EDGE) / (NIR + RED EDGE)
> ```

#### [MSAVI](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-modified-soil-adjusted-vegetation-index)

It is designed to mitigate the effects of soil on crop monitoring results. Therefore, we will apply it when NDVI cannot provide accurate values, especially with a high percentage of bare soil, sparse vegetation, or low chlorophyll content in plants. We will implement it at the beginning of the crop production season when seedlings begin to establish.

> ```
> Fórmula: MSAVI = (2 * Band 4 + 1 – sqrt ((2 * Band 4 + 1)2 – 8 * (Band 4 – Band 3))) / 2
> ```

2. The plantations will be home to thousands of birds, bees, and microorganisms, in short, instead of depleting environmental resources, they contribute to biodiversity preservation and water improvement and protection.
3. It promotes a regenerative and environmentally friendly agricultural model, enhancing the quality of life for communities.
4. It advocates for a model where the community is an integral part of the project, directly benefiting from the profits and creating decent employment for hundreds of families.
5. Investment Oversight \[Weekly, Monthly & Real Time Reports\]

## Eco-Friendly Agriculture

* Following Global Climate Goals
* Circular Farming System
* Local Production, Land Use & Biodiversity
* Water, Carbon & Energy

#### Advantages of Regenerative Agriculture

1. Organic Soil Rebuilding and Mineralization, with Fertility Recovery.
2. Carbon Dioxide Absorption.
3. Drastic Reduction in Emissions and Resource Consumption Due to Tillage.
4. Soil Erosion Prevention, Beneficial for Hydrogeological Territory Safety.
5. Groundwater Protection, Thanks to Reduced or Absent Pesticide and Fertilizer Runoff.
6. Reduced Costs Associated with Pesticide Management and Treatments.

> Fertile land also absorbs much more atmospheric CO2 and can store it as carbon in the soil, reducing its atmospheric concentration. This results in purer air to breathe and helps mitigate the greenhouse effect. Furthermore, preserved natural habitats are a necessary condition for promoting biodiversity.

## 5 Principles of Regeneration

Kokonut Framework implement various regenerative agriculture techniques, and for this, we consider the five principles defined by [Gabe Brown](https://soilhealthacademy.org/team/gabe-brown/)

1. Elimination of mechanical, chemical, and physical field treatments. This regenerative agriculture principle is associated with pre-industrial farming techniques.
2. Year-round use of cover crops to prevent bare soils and mitigate erosion. This regenerative agriculture method also provides forage and grazing material for poultry and livestock.
3. Enhancement of biodiversity (e.g., through crop rotation, agroforestry, and silvopastoral techniques).
4. Incorporation of livestock into agricultural production.
5. Conservation of living roots from perennial crops. These principles aim to ensure a cycle of regenerative agriculture season after season, year after year.

> However, they are not universal, and their combinations and applications depend on the specific characteristics of each particular farm.

### Non-negotiable techniques

* [**Cover Crops**](https://www.fao.org/conservation-agriculture/in-practice/soil-organic-cover/en/): These are crops planted to increase soil fertility, and water retention capacity, enhancing biodiversity, and reducing the potential for pests in the main crop.
* **No-Till Farming**: No-till farming minimizes soil disturbance, reducing soil erosion and carbon dioxide emissions. In this approach, planting is done using specialized drills.
* **Animal Integration in Agricultural Production**: This combination promotes soil fertility, assists in weed and pest management by introducing biological enemies to unwanted species, and benefits the livestock itself, bringing regenerative agriculture closer to wildlife conditions.
* **Perennial Crops**: Perennial crops in regenerative agriculture protect the soil from water and wind erosion by anchoring it with strong roots. They retain moisture and reduce agricultural costs by decreasing plowing and weed control operations.
* **Compost and Compost Tea**: Organic compost provides organic matter and restores soil fertility, a key goal in regenerative organic farming. The optimal concentration of organic matter in the topsoil ranges from 3% to 5% and should be incorporated into the soil profile to a depth of at least six inches. Compost tea is a liquid preparation (hence the name) that introduces vital microorganisms and soluble nutrients essential for plant growth.

# Kokonut Framework Add-Ons

### Impact Assessment Frameworks: Explaining Kokonut Framework Impact ☀️

## EBF Framework

#### What is EBF?

The Ecological Benefits Framework (EBF) is a new paradigm. It provides a foundational architecture to radically transform global carbon and ecological benefits markets both by increasing transparency, trust, quality, and equity and by accelerating the coordinated delivery of positive financial and environmental impacts.

By developing a shared framework, EBF can create alignment across public and private sectors to support the rapid deployment of strategic capital for activities that create measurable, life-affirming ecological impacts. The unprecedented coordination of financial markets, UN agencies, NGOs, companies, and philanthropic interests will bring attention to—and help create—a shared pathway for accelerated solutions.

#### Why do we need a common framework for ecological benefits?

We need to move out of the Age of Extraction and enter the Age of Regeneration. Over the past 12,000 years, human history has borne witness to the unyielding pursuit of resources through extractive, one-way practices. The repercussions of this Age of Extraction are everywhere: biodiversity collapse, species loss, water scarcity, barren topsoils, unbreathable air, climate change, and the threat of worsening living conditions for hundreds of millions of humans.

#### Is EBF a data standard or a certification?

Neither. It is a set of definitions and agreements. Taken together, they form a playbook. Bluetooth is a technology standard. It’s a wireless communication protocol (or digital handshake) that allows any Bluetooth-enabled device (e.g., a cell phone) to communicate to similarly enabled devices (e.g., refrigerators, headphones, televisions, light bulbs, etc.) regardless of manufacturer, brand, or model.

#### Is this framework for ecological benefits designed to replace carbon markets?

No, it is an expansion.

The compliance and voluntary carbon markets serve valuable roles by helping interested parties reach their stated objectives related to sustainability – from ESG to compliance, to business and financial goals – while also contributing to the fight against climate change. However, when considered holistically, carbon is part of larger natural systems that include air, water, soil, biodiversity, and equity.

#### Can the operational efficiency and scale of carbon markets improve by incorporating a shared framework for ecological benefits?

Projects and claims placed on carbon markets are rewarded for activities that reduce, eliminate, or avoid the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. But GHG emission reductions are not the only benefit happening. Air quality may also improve. Biodiversity may increase. The quality of life in impacted communities may improve for people living in impacted communities.
